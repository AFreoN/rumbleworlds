        I. PERSONAL DATA AND INFORMATION
      </h3>
      <p className="body-2 pb-5">
        Rumble Worlds is the administrator of Personal Data provided by Users in

        GDPR Regulation, and in cases wherever required, with consent of the
        Users.
        <br /> <br />
        Rumble Worlds collects only the data that is necessary for functionality
        to conclude an agreement, and to conduct usage and analytical
        assessments, to provide the Service to the Users or any other person
        browsing the Website, and to provide updates by way of blogs and
        newsletters to the Users. General and Personal information we collect
        includes:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Email Address. ​</li>
        </ul>
        <br /> <br />
        In the cases required by the provisions of the applicable laws and
        regulations, including the GDPR Regulation, the Users consent to
        collecting, processing, and storing of their personal data by the Rumble
        Worlds with the purposes to:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>contact the Users by the Rumble Worlds; </li>
          <li>enable use of the Service of Rumble Worlds; and ​</li>
          <li>receive updates from the Rumble Worlds.</li>
        </ul>
        <br /> <br />
        The Users may revoke their consent to the processing of personal data at
        any time by duly communicating the same to the Rumble Worlds.
        <br /> <br />
        ​ It is voluntary for User to provide the information marked as
        required, however providing such information is necessary to conclude
        the agreement and for the use of Service. If the User does not provide
        the required personal data, and does not consent to collecting,
        processing and storage of personal data, it will not be possible for the
        Rumble Worlds to register an account in its system for such User, and to
        conclude an agreement and avail the Service. ​
        <br /> <br />
        The grounds for the Rumble Worlds to process personal data provided are:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          ​<li>the functionality requirements of the Service;</li>
          <li>
            the need of Rumble Worlds to perform contractual obligations towards
            the Users; and
          </li>
          <li>
            to take the necessary actions prior to entering into an agreement
            with the Users at the Users’ request.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /> <br />
        ​ For the marketing of the Service, and sending information on its
        offers or updates to the e-mail address(es) provided by the Users, the
        ground for processing of Users’ personal data is in pursuance of the
        legitimate interests of the Rumble Worlds.
        <br /> <br />
        ​ In the case of providing newsletter or blog updates, the ground for
        processing of data is Users’ consent, which the Users may revoke at any
        time by duly intimating to the Rumble Worlds. ​
        <br /> <br />
        Users’ personal data will be stored in such form allowing for
        identification of the Users, and such storage will not be longer than is
        necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are collected and
        lawfully processed. After that time, data will be processed for the
        period necessary to resolve any potential disputes that may arise in
        connection with the Service, e.g. relating to claims (the period shall
        include the period of limitation of claims under the contract, in
        accordance with the provisions in force of the applicable law).
